The following entry-points are not yet available in this library, and will be added over time:

/entity* ; except entity/client{,-v2,-v3},{,/portfolio,/cashflow}
/portfolio* ; except /portfolio/{position,profit_analysis/detail,transaction,transaction_types}
/riskresearcher*
/supersolver*
/sysadmin*
/task*
/task_template*
/thread*
/trading*
/user_message*
/utilities*
/view_config*
/xmerge*

As you can see, this library is still in it's early stages

More things To do:

- Add better tracing. This would make it possible to test parts of the library
  without needing a server to talk to. (Only for call HTTP format, etc)
- Add OAuth2 Support. Include support for dynamic changing between auth method. (change-class)
- Add helper macro so fetching large amounts of data with pages is automated
  Idea: It will loop over API-form until returned amount is less then page_size
- Add helper macro so batch with more then 100 subrequests are simulated
  Idea: Use transactions (create if needed) to do multi-span calls, will need
  helper macro so that JSONPath can be patched for references over a single
  batch request scope.
