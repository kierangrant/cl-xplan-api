Extra Notes:

Some Extra notes will appear in the other files if possible, otherwise they will be included here:

Bookmarks:
Just like as in Transactions, the page_bookmark parameter when used in a GET request, must also NOT be URL-encoded... otherwise XPlan throws errors.
That is, do not convert "=" to "%3D".
This only affects non Batched Requests. Batched Requests have no URL encoding.
